============

[![Build Status Badge](https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg?branch=python3)](https://github.com/wonderbird/maat-scripts/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

Scripts used to post-process the results from Code Maat.

These scripts are referenced from my upcoming book [Code as a Crime Scene](http://pragprog.com/book/atcrime/code-as-a-crime-scene).

It's work in progress - none of the scripts is of production quality!

The [master](https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts/tree/master) branch is compatible with Python 2.7
while the [pyhton3](https://github.com/adamtornhill/maat-scripts/tree/python3) branch is compatible with Python 3.
